      a: "Loop engineering means writing automated workflows that prompt the AI, run its output through a verifier (tests, CI, a compiler), feed failures back as new instructions, and repeat — until the result is correct. Boris Cherny, who leads Claude Code at Anthropic, said he no longer crafts prompts by hand: he writes the loops that do it for him. The key insight is that the bottleneck was never the prompt — it was the human in the feedback cycle.",

      q: "How does Fractera implement the agentic development loop in production?",
      a: "Fractera runs Hermes as the orchestrator: it reads project context from LightRAG graph memory, picks the right coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Qwen, or Kimi) for each task, hands it a grounded context set, and loops on the build result — feeding errors back as new tasks until the code is green and deployed. The outcome is recorded in LightRAG so every subsequent loop starts smarter.",

      q: "Do I need to write code to run the autonomous development loop with Fractera?",
      a: "No. You describe the goal in natural language — through the Hermes chat inside your workspace or from Telegram. Hermes turns that into a concrete coding task, picks the best agent, and runs the loop. You watch the project take shape in real time; no code is written by you.",
