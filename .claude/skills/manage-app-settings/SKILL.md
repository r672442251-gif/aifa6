  Read or change the deployed app's settings — brand name, description, URL, support
  email, SEO/OpenGraph, PWA, analytics, structured data — and the app's language set.
  Use when the owner says things like "change my description to 'Рога и копыта'",
  "set the site URL", "turn on the Organization schema", or "add French". Writes go
  through the validated setter (the panel's config API) — never raw JSON. Self-sufficient:
  reads work from the on-disk file alone; writes need the setter, which is registered in
  every agent.

# manage-app-settings

Change what the deployed app shows about itself. This is the agent-facing side of the
Admin → **App Settings** panel: the same settings, editable by you on the owner's behalf.

## The one rule that governs writes

**Read directly. Write only through the validated setter. Never hand-write raw JSON.**

Why: an agent that edits `app-config.json` by hand can emit broken JSON (the Shell then
fails to parse the config), clobber other keys with an eyeballed merge, mis-nest a path,
write a string where a number/flag/choice belongs, or race the panel/another agent with a
non-atomic write. The setter removes every one of those failure modes — it validates each
value against the field catalog, merges safely, and writes atomically. So:

- **Reading** a setting is safe to do straight from the file — reading never corrupts.
- **Writing** a setting goes through the setter, always. The setter is the single write path.

## Where settings live (two stores)

| Setting group | Store | Apply | Setter |
|---|---|---|---|
| Brand/identity, SEO, OpenGraph, PWA, author, analytics, JSON-LD, address | **JSON file** `app/APP-CONFIG/app-config.json` (runtime, deep-merged over code defaults) | **instant** — next page load, NO rebuild | the panel route `/api/config/site` |
| **Language set** (which languages + default) | **env** `app/.env.local` (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_LOCALE`) | **needs a REBUILD** (build-time, feeds static page generation) | the panel route `/api/config/languages` + rebuild |
| **Images** (logo, icon set, OG image, illustrations, author photo) | object storage; the JSON file holds only a URL/id | instant once uploaded | NOT a text field — owner uploads in the panel (you may set a URL through the setter if you already have one) |

Field catalog (path · role · type) is the source of truth and what the setter validates
against: the panel's own field list and
`bridges/platforms/app-settings-catalog.js` (same list).

## Confirm before writing (mandatory)

Restate the change to the owner and show exactly what will be written (which path, old →
new value). Write only after explicit confirmation. Never change settings silently.

## Reading current settings

Either ask the setter (preferred — gives roles + whether each field is filled) or just read
the file:

- The panel's site settings page — every text setting with role, current value,
  is-set flag.
- The same page marks the ones still on defaults (worth prompting the owner about).
- The panel's Languages page — the language set + default.
- No panel at hand? Read `app/APP-CONFIG/app-config.json` directly — reading is safe.

## Writing — the setter (this is THE write path, for every agent)

The validated setter is the panel's own config API, reachable from any agent working in this
project. This is what makes the skill
self-sufficient: the safe write path travels with the agent.

- `POST /api/config/site` `{ path, value }` — set ONE field, e.g.
  `{ "path": "description", "value": "Рога и копыта" }`. Validated against the catalog,
  atomic, applies on next load (no rebuild).
- `POST /api/config/languages` `{ languages, defaultLanguage? }` — set the language
  set, e.g. `{ "languages": ["en","es","fr"] }`. `en` is always kept as the fallback.
  A rebuild is required — tell the owner languages appear only after it (a few minutes).

If the bridge is not reachable but the Shell is running, the panel's HTTP routes are the
same validated setter: `POST /api/config/site` (text) and `POST /api/config/languages`
(env + rebuild trigger). Prefer these over touching files.

## Last resort only — raw file edit (dangerous, when NO setter exists)

Use this **only** if there is genuinely no setter available: no `app-settings-bridge` in
the config API is not running. It is the worst write path
(unvalidated, easy to corrupt) — fall back to it knowingly, and mitigate every risk:

**Text / branding / SEO / PWA → `app/APP-CONFIG/app-config.json`:**
1. Read the file first (create from `{}` if missing — the Shell deep-merges over code
   defaults, so a partial object is valid). **Merge — never overwrite the whole file.**
2. Set only the dot-path from the catalog, matching its declared type exactly. Nested paths
   map to nested objects (`seo.titleTemplate` → `{ "seo": { "titleTemplate": "…" } }`).
3. Validate the result is well-formed JSON before saving. Write atomically (write a temp
   file, then rename over the target) so a crash can't leave a half-written config.
4. The Shell reads it per request → the change shows on the next page load.

**Language set → `app/.env.local` + rebuild:**
1. Upsert `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES=en,es,fr` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_LOCALE=en`
   (keep `en`; ISO codes). Preserve all other lines.
2. Trigger a rebuild — the new languages only appear after the app is rebuilt. Tell the
   owner it takes a few minutes.

**Images:** tell the owner to upload in Admin → App Settings (it crops + stores the file).
If you already have a hosted image URL, set the `images.*` path through the setter.

## After changing

Report to the owner, e.g.:
> Set `description` → "Рога и копыта" in App Settings. It shows on the next page load.

For languages, always add: "languages apply after a rebuild (a few minutes)".
