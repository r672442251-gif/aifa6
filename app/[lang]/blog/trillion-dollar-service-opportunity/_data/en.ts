  title: 'The Trillion-Dollar Opportunity Is the Salon Next Door',
  subtitle:
    'Elon Musk talked about space, AI and cars. The line that stayed with me was simpler: most businesses on earth still have no API. Here is the niche I found because of it.',
  description:
    'Why the biggest near-term money in AI is not a unicorn — it is the hair salon, the clinic, the dental office next door. The no-show problem, the businesses with no site and no CRM, and how Fractera lets almost anyone automate them in ten minutes.',
  excerpt:
    'Elon Musk said most businesses still have no API — they run on a phone, or without one. I spent dozens of meetings chasing that idea and found a niche hiding in plain sight: the salon, the clinic, the dental office next door.',

        'This is a slightly unusual post, because it starts with someone else. The Elon Musk interview above caught my attention — he talked about space, about artificial intelligence, about cars. But the moment that inspired me most was a quiet one. He said that despite how the modern world feels — as if everything has already been invented, every site built, every app shipped, every business process automated — the overwhelming majority of businesses on earth do not even have an API. They run on a phone. Some of them run without even that.',

It’s close to a trillion dollars all in, for customer service.',

That barrier is exactly what Fractera removes — which is why this quiet line, not the rockets, is the one I kept.',

Despite an abundance of automation and CRM systems, they run into a problem surprisingly often: a client leaves a request, books a visit — and then does not come.
