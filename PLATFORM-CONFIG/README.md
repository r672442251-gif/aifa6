# PLATFORM-CONFIG — which capabilities are switched ON

Holds `platform-config.json`: the owner's feature switches. Ten booleans under `features` —
`topMenu`, `footerPages`, `cookieBanner`, `offlineCache`, `auth`, `breadcrumbs`, `faq`,
`themeToggle`, `widthToggle`, `languageSwitcher` — plus the parallel-routing mode.

## How it works

**The control panel (`:3002`) writes it. This application (`:3000`) reads it** through
`featureOn()` / `featureDecided()` in `config/platform-config.ts`. Same contract as the
neighbouring `APP-CONFIG`: one file, one writer, one reader, read per request, applied without
a rebuild.

**A missing file is normal** — it means the owner has not touched a switch yet, and the code
defaults apply (`FEATURE_DEFAULTS`). An unreadable file behaves the same way: serving the app
with defaults is honester than failing a page over one broken bracket in a settings file.

**`features` and `explicit` are different questions**, and confusing them breaks working
servers. "Off by default" is not "the owner turned it off": the fallback applies only until the
owner has spoken, and stops the moment they touch the switch. Ask `featureDecided()` when the
difference matters.

## Rules

- **Never import this from a client component** — it reads from disk. Resolve values in a
  server component and pass them to islands as props.
- **Never read the path directly.** Go through `featureOn()`, so the defaults, the caching and
  the missing-file behaviour stay in one place.
- **The language set does NOT live here.** It is `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES` in
  `.env.local`, and that is its only home: the set is baked into the build, so it must be
  stored where the build reads it. A `languages` mirror used to sit in this file and was
  removed on 2026-08-15 — it was written by the panel and read by nobody, which is exactly how
  two sources of truth start.
- **No secrets here.** Ten booleans, nothing else. This file is tracked by git.
